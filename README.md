# Phone Number Locator using phonenumbers Module

This Python script allows users to determine the **country** and **carrier** of a given phone number using the `phonenumbers` module.

## Features
- Identify the **country** where a phone number is registered.
- Detect the **carrier** (e.g., Safaricom, Airtel, Verizon) of the phone number.
- Supports multiple countries using E.164 format (e.g., `+254712345678` for Kenya).
- Easy to use and requires only a phone number as input.

## What This Script Cannot Do
- **Exact Location Tracking**: This module does not provide real-time GPS tracking.
- **User Location**: It only detects the country based on the phone number's prefix, not where the user is currently located.
- **Live Status**: It does not check if the number is active or currently in use.

## Installation
To use this script, first install the `phonenumbers` package:
```sh
pip install phonenumbers
```

## Usage
### Running the Script
1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script's directory.
3. Run the script in Python:

```sh
python phonelocationtrack.py
```
